Write a function detectAndCountLoop() that checks whether a given Linked List contains loop and if loop is present then returns count of nodes in loop.

For example, the loop is present in below-linked list and length of the loop is 4.

```
[1] -> [2] -> [3]
        ^      |
        |      V
       [5] <- [4]
```
       
 If the loop is not present, then the function should return 0.
